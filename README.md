# Peoplenet

Peoplenet is a Layer 2 blockchain project that leverages the power of Solid Pods and Ethereum's Optimism to create a decentralized, scalable, and user-centric network. The project introduces a unique organizational structure called AAO (Acentric Autonomous Organization) and uses two ERC20 tokens, REP and PNT, to incentivize participation and maintain the network's governance. Peoplenet also incorporates a robust dispute resolution mechanism, combining off-chain dispute resolution and the Kleros protocol.
