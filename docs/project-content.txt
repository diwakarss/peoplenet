PeopleNet: Decentralized Digital Society and AAO Facet Architecture
1. Introduction

PeopleNet is a blockchain-based infrastructure designed to democratize technology, empower individuals, and establish a decentralized digital society. It leverages Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solutions like zkSync and Polygon, Acentric Autonomous Organizations (AAOs), and Solid PODs for data privacy and self-sovereign identity management. By focusing on mass blockchain adoption in India, PeopleNet aims to bridge economic and technological divides, creating a user-centric, censorship-resistant ecosystem.
2. Core Components
2.1 Layer 2 Scaling & Hybrid Chain Architecture

PeopleNetâ€™s chain-of-chains model optimizes transaction efficiency by:

    Utilizing zkSync for zero-knowledge rollups, reducing gas fees while preserving security.
    Integrating Polygonâ€™s Layer 2 framework for child chains, enabling flexible dApp interactions.
    Establishing a multi-tier architecture where microchains operate independently but synchronize key transactions with macrochains and Ethereum mainnet.

2.2 Acentric Autonomous Organizations (AAOs)

AAOs are decentralized, self-governing entities that facilitate collaboration between users and AI agents. Each AAO functions as a mini-blockchain, executing governance, transactions, and automation.
AAO Use Cases

    Expense Tracking: A shared AAO among friends to track and split payments.
    Automated News Networks: Bots moderate and curate discussions.
    Event Betting: Smart contracts facilitate betting with human arbitration.
    Bounty Systems: Task completion is verified via AI and smart contracts for automated payouts.

3. Governance, Reputation & Token Economy
3.1 Tokenomics

PeopleNet operates with three primary tokens:

    KAS (ERC-20, INR-pegged): The primary currency of the ecosystem.
    REP (Non-transferable Reputation Token): Earned based on user actions, governing credibility.
    PNT (Gasless Transactions): Enables zero-cost transactions within the network.

3.2 Governance Mechanisms

    Direct democracy: Token holders vote on proposals and governance changes.
    AI-assisted arbitration: Resolves disputes within AAOs.
    Reputation-weighted governance: REP scores influence decision-making power.

4. AAO Facet Technical Architecture
4.1 AAO Lifecycle Management

    Creation: createAAO(string topic, uint256 duration)
    Modification: modifyAAO(uint256 aaoId, string newTopic, uint256 newDuration)
    Termination: terminateAAO(uint256 aaoId)

4.2 Member & Role Management

    Join/Leave: joinAAO(uint256 aaoId), leaveAAO(uint256 aaoId)
    Role-based access control (RBAC): Assign permissions dynamically.

4.3 Reputation & Trust System

    Award REP: awardREP(address userId, uint256 amount)
    Deduct REP: deductREP(address userId, uint256 amount)

4.4 Transaction Handling (PNT)

    Zero-gas payments: executeTransaction(uint256 aaoId, address to, uint256 amount)

4.5 Governance & Voting

    Voting Proposal Submission: submitProposal(uint256 aaoId, string proposalText)
    Voting Execution: executeVote(uint256 aaoId, uint256 proposalId)

4.6 Dispute Resolution

    Human & AI arbitration layers
    Integration with external arbitrators

4.7 Task & Bounty Systems

    Task Creation: createBounty(string taskDescription, uint256 rewardAmount)
    Task Verification: AI & human auditors validate completion.

5. Data Privacy & Security
5.1 Solid PODs for Data Sovereignty

    Cryptographic POD: Secure authentication & keys.
    Data POD: Stores user interactions, wallet states, and personal data.

5.2 Decentralized Identity & Security

    Self-sovereign identity (SSI) for authentication.
    End-to-end encrypted interactions ensuring privacy.

6. Interoperability & Cross-Chain Functionality
6.1 Ethereum & Layer 2 Bridges

    zkSync-Polygon interoperability: Facilitates cross-chain asset transfers.
    Token Bridges: KAS, REP, and PNT support seamless movement between chains.

6.2 Smart Contract Integration

    AAOFacet.sol: Core contract handling AAO operations.
    MacroChainManager.sol & MicroChainManager.sol: Manages hierarchical chain interactions.

7. Development Roadmap
Phase 1: Core AAO Smart Contracts

    âœ… Implement AAO Factory for flexible AAO creation.
    âœ… Develop Smart Contract Governance & Reputation Mechanism.

Phase 2: Layer 2 & POD Integration
