PeopleNet Development Roadmap
Based on an analysis of the current codebase and project documentation, I've identified several gaps between the current implementation (focused on cryptographic foundations) and the broader vision of PeopleNet. The following roadmap outlines a structured approach to development.
Phase 1: Core Cryptographic Infrastructure (Q3 2024)
Current Status: ‚úÖ Nearly Complete
‚úÖ AES-GCM encryption/decryption library
‚úÖ Key management and sharing protocols
‚úÖ Threshold encryption
‚úÖ Complete formal verification for all cryptographic operations
‚è≥ Security audit of cryptographic libraries
Next Steps:
Finalize CryptoProperties formal verification
Expand test coverage for edge cases
Document API interfaces comprehensively
Phase 2: AAO Foundation & Token Economy (Q4 2024)
Status: üîÑ Planned
‚è≥ Implement AAO core contracts
AAOFacet.sol for contract interactions
AAO Factory for flexible organization creation
Role and permission management
‚è≥ Token infrastructure
KAS token implementation (ERC-20, INR-pegged)
REP token for reputation (non-transferable)
PNT token for gasless transactions
Technical Dependencies:
Leverage cryptographic libraries for secure organization management
Integrate Diamond pattern (already in codebase) for upgradable contracts
Phase 3: Data Privacy & Identity (Q1 2025)
Status: üîÑ Planned
