The global market landscape is predominantly capitalistic. While capitalism has its merits, it often leads
to wealth accumulation in the hands of a few. This
economic disparity is starkly evident in the digital

ularity, it began facing challenges that are inherent
to its design and architecture.

2.4

The Absence of a Truly Altruistic 3.1 Scalability
Network
One of the most pressing issues facing Ethereum
today is scalability[9]. As more and more transactions
are processed on the network, the time taken to
validate and add these transactions to the blockchain
increases. This results in a bottleneck, slowing down
the entire system and leading to increased transaction
fees.

Most digital platforms operate with profit as the
primary motive. While there’s nothing inherently
wrong with seeking profit, it often comes at the cost
of user interests. The digital realm is in dire need
of a truly altruistic network, one that places user
interests at the forefront, operating not for profit but
for the greater good.

the system’s overall security.
Ethereum’s transition from a Proof-of-Work (PoW)
to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism is a
monumental shift[6]. While PoS promises energy efficiency and scalability, the transition is complex and
poses risks, especially concerning network security
and validator centralization.
In summary, while Ethereum has paved the way
for decentralized applications and smart contracts, it
faces challenges that need addressing for it to remain
the leading platform for decentralized innovations.

2. Decentralization: Unlike traditional organizations, AAOs are not bound by hierarchical
structures. Power and decision-making are distributed among members, fostering a democratic
environment.

Acentric Autonomous Organizations (AAOs) form
the backbone of the PeopleNet ecosystem, serving
as multipurpose vehicles for online systems. These
decentralized entities empower individuals and groups
to create, manage, and operate their digital platforms
with autonomy, transparency, and security.

3. Transparency: All operations, transactions,
and decisions within an AAO are recorded on
the blockchain, ensuring complete transparency
and accountability.
